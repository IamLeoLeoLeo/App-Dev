## Story
Jujutsu Kaisen (呪術廻戦, Meaning 'Sorcery Battle') is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Gege Akutami. It was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from March 2018 to September 2024, with its chapters collected in 30 tankōbon volumes. Jujutsu Kaisen is a sequel to Akutami's Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School, serialized in Shueisha's Jump Giga from April to July 2017, later collected in a single tankōbon volume, retroactively titled as Jujutsu Kaisen 0, in December 2018.
## Plot Summary
Yuji Itadori is a high school student with unnatural physical strength and athletic ability. One day at school, his friends attract Curses by unsealing a rotten finger talisman. Yuji swallows the finger to protect Jujutsu Sorcerer student Megumi Fushiguro, tasked with retrieving the finger, unwittingly becoming host to the powerful ancient sorcerer Ryomen Sukuna. The leaders of the Jujutsu Society intend to exorcise Sukuna, and Yuji by extension. However, noticing Yuji's capability to retain control over his body, Satoru Gojo—Megumi's teacher and the strongest sorcerer in the modern Jujutsu world—brings him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School for training. Gojo has Yuji's execution postponed until he consumes all twenty of Sukuna's fingers, thereby enabling Sukuna's complete destruction through his death.

Meanwhile, a group of intelligent Cursed Spirits plot an elaborate attack to reform Jujutsu according to their ideals, beginning with sealing away Gojo, whose power and influence maintain order within the Jujutsu world. The group is led by Suguru Geto, a mysterious sorcerer and Curse User believed to have been killed by Gojo a year earlier, whose entourage includes the sadistic Curse Mahito, fire Curse Jogo, and nature Curse Hanami. Gojo's class of first-years—Yuji, Megumi, and Nobara Kugisaki—train by taking on missions to exorcise low-level Curses; during these, Sukuna becomes interested in Megumi's cursed technique and potential. Yuji is devastated after Mahito kills his friend Junpei Yoshino, confronting him with the harsh reality of the Jujutsu world he has entered. During an inter-school competition between the Tokyo and Kyoto branches, Mahito infiltrates Tokyo Jujutsu High and steals three "Death Paintings"—dormant half-human half-Curses—before summoning them to their full form. Yuji and Nobara exorcise two of them during a mission, leaving Choso as the sole surviving Death Painting.

On Halloween night in Shibuya, Geto's group launches their plan. Gojo destroys Hanami but is ultimately sealed by Geto, revealed to be the ancient sorcerer Kenjaku inhabiting Geto's corpse. With Gojo removed, chaos erupts. Choso defeats Yuji but spares him after a vision reveals they are brothers. Jogo force-feeds Yuji ten Sukuna fingers, allowing Sukuna to briefly take control. Sukuna kills Jogo and battles Megumi's uncontrollable shikigami Mahoraga, nearly destroying all of Shibuya in the process. Yuji witnesses Mahito killing his mentor and Gojo's colleague, Kento Nanami, and severely wounding Nobara, breaking him emotionally. With help from Kyoto student Aoi Todo, Yuji defeats Mahito, but Kenjaku absorbs the Curse and awakens countless sorcerers, advancing his millennia-old plan for a new era of Cursed Spirits.

In the aftermath, the Jujutsu higher-ups reinstate Yuji's immediate execution and appoint second-year student Yuta Okkotsu as his executioner. Loyal to Gojo, Yuta helps Yuji fake his death and joins him in seeking Master Tengen—an immortal, part-Curse part-human sorcerer. Tengen reveals Kenjaku's plan to merge the former's consciousness with the entire Japanese population through the "Culling Games"—a battle royale among the awakened sorcerers designed to accumulate vast amounts of Cursed Energy. Yuji and his allies search for a mysterious woman known as "Angel", who can unseal Gojo and help rescue Megumi's stepsister, Tsumiki, from being forced into the Culling Games. Kenjaku captures Tengen, and after finding Angel, Yuji and Megumi discover that Tsumiki's body has been overtaken by the ancient sorcerer Yorozu. Sukuna takes over, removes one of his own fingers, and forces Megumi to swallow it, transferring himself into Megumi's body. Sukuna kills Yorozu, resulting in Tsumiki's death, and crushes Megumi's will to resist his possession.

The group successfully unseals Gojo. Days later, Gojo battles Sukuna. Gojo nearly wins but drops his guard, causing a weakened Sukuna to fatally bisect him. Kenjaku is confronted by Fumihiko Takaba, a sorcerer who proves to be an effective distraction for Yuta to catch him off-guard and behead him. Before dying, Kenjaku makes Sukuna the Culling Games' master. The remaining Jujutsu Sorcerers attempt to fight Sukuna in Gojo's place but are overpowered as Sukuna regains his true form. In a flashback, it is revealed that Sukuna ate his twin brother in the womb a thousand years ago. The twin's soul reincarnated into Yuji's lineage, and Kenjaku's possession of Yuji's mother during conception combined to forge his unique physique and his capacity to host Sukuna.

With help from his allies, Yuji manages to overpower Sukuna, although Choso sacrifices himself in the process. Sukuna is stunned when Gojo reappears, only to be revealed as Yuta using Kenjaku's copied Cursed Technique to switch bodies. Yuji activates his Domain Expansion, dragging Sukuna through a vision of his hometown in a futile attempt to sway him. During this, he reaches Megumi's soul and inspires him to resist Sukuna's control. Sukuna realizes Yuji is missing one finger—used by Yuta to activate the Cursed Technique. Nobara then locates Sukuna's last finger, hidden by Gojo, and uses her Cursed Technique to strike it, simultaneously damaging Sukuna's soul and allowing Yuji to deliver a final blow. Megumi successfully frees himself from Sukuna, who disintegrates away after refusing a final chance from Yuji.

After the battle, Yuta returns to his original body. Yuji, Megumi, and Nobara undertake another mission, and Yuji reflects on Gojo's hopes and trust in him. Although Sukuna's last finger is shown, his defeat makes his return unlikely.

**Ryomen Sukuna**

Ryomen Sukuna (両りょう面めん宿すく儺な Ryōmen Sukuna?), more often referred to as simply Sukuna (宿すく儺な Sukuna?), is history’s strongest jujutsu sorcerer, born over a thousand years ago. Regarded as the undisputed King of Curses (呪のろいの王おう Noroi no Ō?), Sukuna is one of the primary antagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series.

In truth, he was an undefeated human sorcerer also known as the Disgraced One (堕だ天てん Daten?), having felled countless jujutsu sorcerers that challenged him. After accepting a proposal from Kenjaku to participate in the Culling Game,Sukuna continued existing after death by transforming himself into a cursed object, a state where his cursed energy and soul was split into his twenty indestructible fingers.

Sukuna was incarnated in June 2018 when Yuji Itadori consumed one of his fingers.[4] Sukuna was trapped inside Yuji's body and was rarely in control until he managed to transfer his soul into the body of Megumi Fushiguro.

## Favorite Scene

There are a lot to chose in both Anime and Manga but I will just put Anime Scenes that are my Favorite

>Gojo Uses His Domain Expansion

<img width="750" height="900" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68b8e2a3-19f1-4692-ba1a-9fe9280f545b" />



I specially like this scene here Gojo flaunts casually how powerful he is against a special grade curse, Jogo, that Yuji knows himself that he can't beat and how powerful the curse compared to the special grade curse that he fought and at that time stronger than Sukuna. This shows how he is fitting to be called the Strongest Sorcerer.


>Yuji's four consecutive Blackflashes


<img width="750" height="375" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d40b8ac-a87e-4bb1-89b6-7ddde60ad9b6" />

It so fun how Yuji really develops his control of curse energy here, he is literally in the Zone making four consecutive blackflashes against one of the strongest curses, this record of black flashes ties with the record of Nanami

>Yujiand Nobara Black Flash 


<img width="750" height="720" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9b29182-f8c0-4e8a-ad94-f312e7974cc7" />


At the last Episode of Season 1, Yuji and Nobara ambushed by two special grade(Unkowingly to Yuji and us at that time, it's yuji's brothers) which uses blood related curse technique, the fight was incredible and creative with how they fared with special grade techniques specially Nobara because she feels she is being left behind but shows her development


## Why I Love It
I love Jujutsu Kaisen because of how hype I'm feeling whenever I watch or read or anything I consume that involves Jujutsu Kaisen. The World Building and concept about curse energy and curses and the plot is very entertaining and interesting. The animation also carries the whole anime. The characters has enough development. Not many series has the hype stories in it and every chapter/episode of jujutsu kaisen and exciting. The comedy is also on point so I enjoyed it so much. What I like about the story is that it is unpredictable unlike other series and generic anime that has that same plot, in Jujutsu kaisen you don't know what will happen, who will die, Gege Akatumi is not scared of abandoning the character even it is well love by the community, (Spoiler Aleeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrt)especially with Gojo Satoru which is the character that I love the most and not just me but the whole fandom.

## Thank You For Reading!!!!!!
